## Introduction

Vision Transformers have revolutionized the field of computer vision by applying the self-attention mechanism to image recognition tasks. This project aims to enhance ViT's performance by incorporating HOG features, which are known for their ability to capture shape and appearance information through gradient distributions[1][8].

## Background

### Vision Transformer (ViT)

ViT treats images as sequences of patches, applying transformer architecture to process these patches for classification tasks. It has shown remarkable performance on various image recognition benchmarks[3].

### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

HOG is a feature descriptor that computes the distribution of gradient orientations in local regions of an image. It is particularly effective in capturing shape information and is resistant to changes in lighting and small variations in pose[7][9].

## Implementation

Our HOG-ViT model modifies the standard ViT architecture by incorporating HOG features:

1. **Image Preprocessing**: Images are resized and normalized.
2. **HOG Feature Extraction**: We apply HOG to extract features from the input images.
3. **Patch Embedding**: The HOG features are divided into patches and linearly projected.
4. **Positional Encoding**: We add learnable positional encodings to retain spatial information.
5. **Transformer Encoder**: A stack of transformer layers processes the patch embeddings.
6. **Classification Head**: The final layer produces class probabilities.

The model is trained end-to-end using cross-entropy loss[4].

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hog-vit.git
cd hog-vit
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To train the model:

```bash
python train.py --epochs 100 --batch-size 256 --learning-rate 0.01
```

To evaluate on a test set:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model-path ./checkpoints/best_model.pth
```

## Results

Our HOG-ViT model has shown promising results on several benchmark datasets:

- CIFAR-10: 75.5% accuracy after 100 epochs[3]
- ASL Dataset: [Insert accuracy]
- NUS Hand Gesture Dataset: [Insert accuracy]

Visualizations of attention maps demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant object features across different classes[3].
